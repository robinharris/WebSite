Robin managed a large IT department for a global healthcare company for 20 years.  Prior
to that he held management roles in Mars UK in supply chain and sales support.  His 
degree is in Microbiology.

Running has been a major feature throughout his life but to 'reduce the load on his knees'
he took up triathlon in the 1990s.  The running continued at the same level but cycling 
and swimming were added.  He has completed 17 Ironman races.
