I have come to regard these objectives as touchstones that increase the likelihood that a project will be satisfying to me:

* Start with a simple idea then simplify it
* Buy as little as possible - make as much as possible
* Perfection is enemy of the good
* Proceed incrementally in small steps
* Test each step and go back if it fails
* Re-purpose materials to hand
* Every step is a learning opportunity
* The goal is not to finish but to enjoy the current step
