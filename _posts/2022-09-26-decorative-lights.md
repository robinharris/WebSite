My daughter asked me for some decorative lighting for their lounge; it needed to be a stylish feature, use LEDs, be dimmable and controlled by a wall panel, smartphone and voice (Alexa).

This is how it turned out:

<img src="/WebSite/images/lights1.jpg" alt="Lights 1" width="300" height="350" title="Lights 1" margin=20px style="padding: 10px; float: right;">

The screens are re-purposed greenhouse heater tube screens primed and painted copper colour.  The bulbs are E27 base tubular in a retro style but actually 5W LEDs.  The cable is rather swanky copper and black cotton covered and the bracket is 3D printed.

Control is achieved with a triac 240V dimmer that is hidden behind the sofa and housed in a 3D printed enclosure to double insulate it.  The dimmer can be controlled by a variety of remotes - I used a wall mounted battery operated one that communicates using 2.4GHz RF.  Finally a WiFi interface was added to allow a phone app to also control the lights via the home network and this also works with Alexa.
