Having not done much with ESP8266 devices for a couple of years I have been looking for a 
suitable project.  I've also been getting to grips with 3D printing and after 8 months am beginning to feel like the basics are under control
I do a lot of outdoor running and cycling so naturally keep a close eye on the weather 
but commercial reports are never quite specific enough for my location.  I really want to
know what the wind speed is **now** and from which direction it is blowing.

Out of these needs came the first solution - buy a commercial weather station, mount the
sensors on a pole outside and use a fancy display to view real time data.  But where is 
the fun in that?  The idea of designing and building my own started to take shape.

Having a 3D printer gives me the ability to design *and* produce suitable enclosures for
the electronics as well as 'Stevenson Screens' for the sensors.
